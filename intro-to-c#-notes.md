# Introduction to C#

## Why C#
- can be used for multiple types of applications and for multiple platforms
- easily scalable

## Syntatic Features
1. you have to add the variable type when declaring(unlike python) it. 
2. uses semi-colons at end of lines like javascript
3. uses "$" for interpolated strings just like python would use "f"``
