# Introduction to C#

## Why C#
- can be used for multiple types of applications and for multiple platforms
- easily scalable

## Features
1. you have to add the variable type when declaring(unlike python) it. 
2. uses semi-colons at end of lines like javascript
3. uses "$" for interpolated strings just like python would use "f"
4. variables and methods use CamelCase
5. integers have max and min values
6. the semi-colon(;) character is expected after every line, unlike javascript where your program can run without it
